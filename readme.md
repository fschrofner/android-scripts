# Android Scripts
Welcome to my personal script collection.  
This repository contains a selection of scripts which I created to make my life as Android developer a bit easier.
Whenever I feel like there's a need for it, I'll add another one.  
Just take what appeals to you, I'd be happy if it helped you in some way!

## Running
All scripts are written in Clojure and require [Babashka](https://babashka.org/) to run.
Just follow the instructions for your operating system on the website. In case there's no proper way of distribution for your OS you can always just download the binary from [their releases](https://github.com/babashka/babashka/releases) and add it to your path, which is what I'm also doing.  

To get info on how to actually use the individual scripts just take a look in the corresponding folder. Normally each folder should contain a readme which explains the purpose and usage of the script.

## License
These scripts are all "unlicensed", see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.
